Hans Kaufmann

Merchant from the wealthy district of Evenfall. 
Hans is a 4th generation arms merchant, mostly focusing on elegant and noble weapons.  
Borderline aristocracy, Hans was trained in martial arts and military strategy as a means of networking with the rich and powerful, 
and has participated in war games and tournaments from a young age. 
He currently travels with one of his most trusted retainers, Wilhelm, who has been the families assistant for as long as Hans can remember.

Hans inherited the family enterprise on the untimely (and suspicious) disappearance of his beloved mother (Greta). 
She had traveled to Veronya on a trip to learn about a new weapon forging method. 
Hans has sent numerous retainers after her, but they never come back with any information.

The Kaufmann family is not the only prestigious merchant family that trades in their area - they have a fierce rivalry with the Mercier family, currently ran by Jacques Mercier. 
Hans secretly has had a unrequited crush on the current heiress, Sophie, but has kept it very secret due to the rivalry and dynamics. 

Hans loves spending time with his drinking buddies, Otto and Bob, at the local tavern, partaking in a shared bierstiefel (drinking boot). 
Fittingly, Hans is always on the lookout for the perfect bierstiefel, or perfect tavern, to take his buddies to.
