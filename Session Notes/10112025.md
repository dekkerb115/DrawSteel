# At the Tavern

- we see some dwarves 
- we chat up the **guilded hand**
  - the hand consists of
    - Baudorf Buckfeather (the polder)
    - Jargon (human man)
    - Mara (human woman)
    - Elwif (wood elf)
    - Dorik (dwarf)
  - Ask us for our group name
  - we regale them with stories of how we saved violet
  - they're looking for something in the lower reaches of the tomb
    - probably past the shield covering the stairs we ignored 
    - they can give us gold or recipes from Mara for helping them
  - intuition check indicates they're shady

# Orson's Shack

- Orson is old man 👴 covered in soot, he makes charcoal
- He asks for our help with a "big bug" in the forest
  - the bug has 8 legs (spider maybe?)
  - the bug jumped out of the ground and chased him while he was looking for wood
  - it shoots "burning goop"
  - the bug took his brass necklace ("looks like skyfire")
  - Bug is killing pigs at Elerie's farm
  - Apparently the bug is getting closer to town
- Orson promised us an apple pie recipe

# Elerie's Farm

- we arrive to a bloodbath (Pig 🐖 carcasses)
- Elerie is burning the carcasses
- The pasture is littered with partially eaten pigs
  - the pigs are missing skin and dissolved
- She only saw the one bug
- it escaped in a tunnel
- The Doctor convinces Elerie to let us take a stubborn pig ("Big Jeb")
- Tax successfully handles Jeb so he comes with us
