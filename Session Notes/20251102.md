# Previous Session Follow Ups
- Identify amulet with Orson (don't forgot the apple pie!)
- Rest

# Out of cave

- We run into a large **moleframe** (mechanical mole)
  - it punches through the roof and falls into a vat of acid
  - it seems damaged
  - The Doctor and Hans try (but fail) to lift the mole out of the acid
  - The Doctor explains that it looks the moleframe ran into the Arix at some point and was damaged
    - Moleframes typically stay near towers, but Broadhurst is not near a tower so it's weird
    - It's destined for Broadhurst
    - They are not hostile
    - On it's back there are a set of (full) clear vials that are not on a typical moleframe

# Elerie's Farm

- Elerie is fine with us taking Jeb
- Jacobim asked if Elerie had yarn for a cute pig scarf for Jeb
- Elerie gives us a gift (beyond the gift of Jeb)
  - An old leatherbound book
    - Journal that her grandmother gave us (in Kaliac)
    - Contains a recipe for a **Buzz balm**
  - A vial filled with reddish viscous fluid
    - it's **demon honey**

# Orson's Shack (Charcoal Burners Hut)
- Orson examines the amulet we found
- We earned his trust, and all the sudden he becomes serious and drops the big dumb smile
  - He's been putting up an act as a big dummy the entire time!
- Invites us inside to eat his apple pie
- Orson has leftover yarn
- Orson explains the amulet
  - Amulet of the **Delian Order** :busts_in_silhouette:
  - He's talked to Abbot **Lorick** :man_with_turban: about our doings, and knows we've made it to the first level of the tomb
  - :exclamation: The amulet opens the second floor of the tomb
  - **Lorik** :man_with_turban: was doing some research into the church records about the tomb
    - There's a magic artifact in the tomb known as the **Cup of Julius** 🍵 that can grant unnattural powers
  - He wants to keep the amulet & the cup out of the **Guilded Hand**'s :hand: hands
  - He's part of the **Coursers** :deciduous_tree: 
    - They are dedicated to protecting the wild places of the world
    - Their ensigna is a 12 pinned lute or something
    - They always operate in pairs
    - His partner is in Evenfall
    - He's claiming their network can take the cup to safety
  - We ask him if he knows anything about the moleframe (or frames in general)
    - He says the Mages Guild/Mechanists guild in Evenfall would know more about them
    - The moleframes seem to be near certain types of ore veins (silver/quicksilver mines)
    - The moleframes seem to work in teams of 2

# Church of Saint Gryphon (meeting Abbot Lorick :man_with_turban:)
- (on our way) Wilhelm is standing in front of the Inn
  - He wants to join the party
  - Hans thinks he's ruining the vibe of the party
- We enter a library room with hundreds of books
- Chatting with Lorick
  - Knows the Chalice is on the 3rd level with a great leader of the order
  - The Doctor reads Lorick and finds he's sincere
  - The Doctor succesfully convinces Lorick to keep this between us (and not tell the Guilded Hand)
  - Lorick gives us some books to read about the **Delian Order** :busts_in_silhouette:
- The Doctor asks if he knows anyone in town who's good at Alchemy. 
  - Dunquat & Harim might know a bit

# Next Time
- Consider reading the **Delian Order** :busts_in_silhouette: books as a downtime activity while side questing 
- Do Mikael (the carpenter)'s quest, hunting something in the Silver Forest
