# Mikael's Carpentry Shop
- As we approach, we hear whistling and sawing
- Mikael :red_haired_man: is happy but bandaged around his right arm
- He was attacked by a large wolf last time he was in the woods (near the north side of the Dun river)
  - Tax notes that it's strange that the wolf didn't finish him off
- Mikael was out late at night searching for wood, but luckily it was a full moon so he could still see. 
- Mikael typically works with Von (woodcutter) :wood::man:, but not this time
- The Doctor identifies that this was likely a werewolf
    - It's possible that Mikael will become a werewolf
- Tax determines that lycanthropy (werewolf disease) can be cured, it takes a while to make the cure tho
    - Ingredients
        - Something from the remains of a werewolf
- The Doctor tells Mikael :red_haired_man: to lock himself up on a full moon

# Scene of the Attack (North side of Dun River)
- Tax searches the area and finds tracks for a large wolf and smaller wolf tracks heading further south along the river
- The Doctor notices that the area around the smaller wolf tracks are more green than the other areas. 
    - The smaller tracks are from "water wolves", water elementals that look like wolves. 
    - Naturally occurring elementals typically arise near sources of chaos, because there has to be a link to an elemental plane
- The Doctor confirms that the law prints are from a werewolf
- The werewolf and water wolves were traveling together

# Cave along the River
- We follow the tracks and find an area where multiple sheep were slaughtered, next to a cave along the banks of the river.
- A middle aged man is shaking and carrying a sheperds staff at the mouth of the cave
- Jacobim introduces us
- Sheperds brother Olek was captured by the werewolf and taken into the cave
    - This was recently, like 10-15 minutes ago
    - The Doctor figures out that werewolfs can turn at will if they accept the curse

# Werewolves Cave
- It's a cave with a river running through it
- Hans sees a number of water wolves in the river
- The Doctor is unable to reason the water wolves
- We no longer have the element of surprise

# Next Time
- Finish the wolf den combat
