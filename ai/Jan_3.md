## Session Overview
The party investigated reports of a werewolf attacking villagers and followed clues into the forest, discovering a more complex situation involving both a werewolf and water elementals.

---

## Opening Scene - Meeting the Carpenter (Mikael)

### Initial Encounter
- Party traveled to visit a local carpenter after being directed by the Abbott
- Found Mikael outside his house, whistling and working on wood
- He had a bandaged right arm from a recent injury

### Mikael's Account
- **The Attack**: Four nights ago during a full moon, Mikael went into the forest to gather wood and was attacked by a large wolf
- **The Injury**: The wolf bit him on the arm before he managed to shake it off and escape
- **Strange Behavior**: The wolf didn't pursue him when he fled, which was unusual
- **Location**: The attack occurred deep in the forest - took most of the afternoon to find suitable trees, didn't return until nightfall

### Additional Context
- Mikael usually works with Vaughn (another woodcutter) but Vaughn has been too afraid to go into the woods
- Vaughn mentioned bandits in the woods as his reason for staying away
- Mikael avoided Vaughn's typical gathering spot but was still attacked

## Party Investigation & Monster Lore

### Doctor's Monster Knowledge Check (Roll: 13)
Based on Mikael's description of a large wolf attacking during a full moon and operating alone (not as part of a pack), the Doctor determined:
- **Likely Identification**: Werewolf
- **Curse Transmission**: The bite wound could transmit lycanthropy

### Medical Examination (Roll: 14)
- The Doctor examined Mikael's wound
- Confirmed it was a bite wound, bleeding badly initially but healing well
- Determined that lycanthropy can be cured, but requires a key ingredient found in werewolf remains

### Warning to Mikael
- Party informed Mikael he might transform during the next full moon
- Advised him to lock himself in a basement or jail cell for safety
- Mentioned they would work on obtaining a cure
- Mikael reluctantly agreed to take precautions

## Journey to the Forest

### Directions from Mikael
- Head east on the road to the river
- Travel south along the northern bank of the Dunn River
- Location is on the north side of the river

### Tracking & Survival Check (Roll: 20)

**Discovered Evidence:**
- Found Mikael's stacked birch wood by the riverbank
- Located tracks from a large wolf (consistent with werewolf)
- **Critical Discovery**: Found smaller wolf tracks traveling alongside the larger tracks

**Monster Lore Analysis (Roll: 18):**
- The smaller tracks showed unusual characteristics - plants grew more abundantly in those areas
- Identification: Water wolves (water-aligned elementals that resemble wolves)
- These are chaotic elemental creatures that can be summoned or occur naturally near elemental plane connections
- The tracks indicated the werewolf and water elementals were traveling together

**Safe Location Found:**
- Party located an ideal defensive position in the area (with the roll of 20)

## The Shepherd Encounter

### Scene Discovery
- Following the tracks, party found multiple slaughtered sheep
- Discovered a frightened middle-aged shepherd standing at a cave entrance
- He was fully clothed, holding a wooden staff defensively, shaking with fear

### The Shepherd's Story
- **The Attack**: 10-15 minutes prior, a large wolf charged out and killed several sheep
- **His Brother**: The shepherd's brother went into the cave and hasn't returned - the shepherd heard him screaming for help
- **Paralyzed by Fear**: The shepherd was too terrified to move or help
- **The Rest**: Other sheep scattered back toward town

### Strategic Discussion
- Party debated whether this was the werewolf or water elementals
- Noted the conflict: Vaughn feared bandits, but werewolves need the full moon to transform
- **Theory**: The werewolf may have achieved mastery over the curse, allowing transformation outside the full moon
- Party offered to rescue the brother in exchange for wool from the sheep (for crafting)

---

## Cave Exploration - First Chamber

### Cave Description
- Narrow entrance that widens into a large, well-lit chamber
- **The River**: A large glowing river runs through the central area
- **Depth**: Approximately 25 feet deep (5 squares)
- **Crossing**: Rocks jut out from the river, creating potential stepping stones
- **Hazard**: Rocks look treacherous - crossing carefully is safe, but rushing requires a check

### Water Elementals Spotted (Intuition Check)

**Discovery:**
- Multiple water elementals (water wolves) are in the river, disturbing the water
- They are arranged in groups of 3-4
- The elementals have noticed the party

### Combat Considerations

**Party Strategy Discussion:**
- Debated crossing the river vs. staying on one side
- Considered throwing sheep carcass pieces as a distraction
- Discussed whether elementals are hostile or could be reasoned with
- Doctor attempted to calm/negotiate with the elementals using Monster Whisperer ability

**Doctor's Negotiation Attempt (Roll: 11)**
- Failed to calm or reason with the water elementals
- Combat appears inevitable

## Session End

### Current Status
- Party positioned at cave entrance, facing water elementals in the glowing river
- Brother still missing deeper in the cave
- Werewolf location unknown
- Combat to begin next session

### Key Mysteries Remaining
1. Why is the werewolf able to transform outside the full moon?
2. What is the connection between the werewolf and water elementals?
3. Is there an elemental plane connection nearby?
4. Will Mikael transform at the next full moon if not cured?
5. Is the shepherd's brother still alive?
